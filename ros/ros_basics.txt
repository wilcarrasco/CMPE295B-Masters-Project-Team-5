* Workspace - set of directories which contain related ROS nodes
 - can only use 1 workspace at a time
 - ROS namespaces delimited by /

* package - organization principle in ROS (container of nodes, files, ...)
 - catkin_create_package
 - has package.xml, defines stuff
 - on ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

* nodes - executable programs - basic unit of programming in ROS

* topics - pub/sub paradigm, a topic is a channel of communication

* messages - way nodes comm w/each other (pub/sub on topics)
 - ROS package std_msgs defines message types

* services
 - ROS RPC
 - when service called, robot waits until the service has ended before doing something else

* actions
 - when you call an action, your robot can still keep doing something else while performing the action.
 - action allow you to provide feedback while the action is being performed

* catkin - ROS build system on top of CMake and make

* rqt_graph - visualizing nodes and topic communication between nodes

* tf package - transform package for coordinate frame management

* Tab completion


ROS Master
 - started by roscore (or roslaunch if not already running)
 - traffic cop for ROS nodes
 - keeps track of nodes, name service
 - all active nodes publish their debug messages to /rosout topic


Common commands
---------------
roscore - starts ROS master, ROS param server, rosout logging node
rosrun
rospack help
rospack list
roscd rospy_tutorials
roscd log

rosnode -h
rosnode list -h
rosnode help: show subcommands
rosnode list: show active NODES (not necessarily running)
rosnode info /rplidarNode

rostopic list - gives list the topics associated with active ROS nodes

Start/stop rplidar (only stops temporarily, kills process, respawns)
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch
rosservice call stop_motor
rosservice call start_motor


rosnode info rplidarNode
rosmsg list
rosmsg show sensor_msgs/LaserScan
rosmsg echo sensor_msgs/LaserScan

rosparam help
rosparam list
